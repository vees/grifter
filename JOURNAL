Problem:

On my local machine I have 45000 pictures, some of which I would not want to upload
to any machine acting as a server.

Objective:

1. Get a list of every image file stored on my private computer.
2. Find and record the MD5 hash to remove any duplicates

Next objective:

Finish editing views.py to link to PictureSimple and base32 to render a random small image
to the test server for proof of concept.
