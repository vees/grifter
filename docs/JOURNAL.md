Problem:

On my local machine I have 45000 pictures, some of which I would not 
to upload to any machine acting as a server.

Objective:

1. Get a list of every image file stored on my private computer.
2. Find and record the MD5 hash to remove any duplicates

Finish editing views.py to link to PictureSimple and base32 to 
render a random small image to the test server for proof of concept.
